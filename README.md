# Ag-Net

## Introduction

Ag-Net is a bundle of customized deep neural networks for recognizing crops based on spectral characteristics. The main idea is to customize the current neural networks like U-Net to make it more suitable for extracting and recognizing the season-changing features of various crop over the growing season. The ultimate goal is to generate high-quality accurate crop maps at any stage of crops rather than waiting for next year. The training and validation ground truth data comes from USGS EarthExplorer and USDA NASS. 

## Dataset

We have created a free sample dataset for direct training and testing of neural network. [Ag-Net-Dataset](https://github.com/ZihengSun/Ag-Net-Dataset)
